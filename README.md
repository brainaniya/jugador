This website was constructed for a Spanish Project. It is a website embedded with several popular games that has a few important features:

1) Games don't require flash which makes them load quicker on school-provided devices
2) Has day and night mode for use in classes which are either bright or dark
3) Automatically muted tab to prevent large distractions in class
4) No advertisements, so gaming experience is much better
5) Back to Work button to redirect back to classwork
6) Clean interface
